== DungeonMaster

DungeonMaster is a planned integrated Dungeons and Dragons webapp for players and dungeon masters alike. 

Dungeon masters benefit from the ability to build appropriately challenging scenarios for tracked characters via the quest simulator, which can determine the likelihood of victory given the current constraints. Given the ability to rank quest difficulty, dungeon masters can also appropriately scale rewards for their players.

The quests app is meant to be used by portable devices like phones or tablets for gameplay tracking of character experience, inventory, and gold. The Encounters feature can be used to simulate the encounters the dungeon master has built into the quest, which the dungeon master can trigger from her phone or computer, revealing the challenge to the other players in the quest.
